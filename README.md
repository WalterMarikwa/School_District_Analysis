## Summary
Unforfunately, it is impossible to identify whether certain individuals are engaging in acdemic dishonestly or exclude them from dataset. As a result, the scores of all ninth-gradres from Thomas High School have been left out from the results. This is a suboptimal situation because a full set of data is ideal for creating the most accurate results.

After NaN scores were submitted from ninth gradres scores, Thomas High School's average scores dropped, As well as district-wide avarage math and reading scores. Therefore, Thomas High School lost its placement as a top five school within this District. In contrast, Thomas High School regained its high average score after updating the total student counts to exclude ninth graders from the dataset and excluding their scores.
